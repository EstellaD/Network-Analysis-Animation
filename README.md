# Network-Analysis-Animation
Leveraging network analysis packages in R to produce an animation of nodes and edges evolving over time.

I want to make causal DAGs move :dancer: :notes:. I am currently following the [tutorial](https://kateto.net/network-visualization), and experimenting on random data. 

My next step will be finding geographical data, and project the dynamic network onto a map. Stay tuned.

#### Requirement
Required R packages are stored in `intall.R`.  A R version of 3.5.3 or above and the packages version as recent as possible are recommended. 

#### Demo Dataset
